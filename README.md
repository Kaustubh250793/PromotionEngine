# PromotionEngine
Problem Statement : Promotion Engine We need you to implement a simple promotion engine for a checkout process. Our Cart contains a list of single character SKU ids (A, B, C. .. ) over which the promotion engine will need to run. The promotion engine will need to calculate the total order value after applying the 2 promotion types • buy 'n' items of a SKU for a fixed price (3 A's for 130) • buy SKU 1 & SKU 2 for a fixed price ( C + D = 30 ) The promotion engine should be modular to allow for more promotion types to be added at a later date (e.g. a future promotion could be x% of a SKU unit price).
